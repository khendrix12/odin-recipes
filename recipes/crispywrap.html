        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Six-sided folded wrap. All the standard taco fixins' stacked in layers. Grilled on both sides.</p>
        <p>This Taco Bell classic is quite easy to make and is much tastier when created at home. They have always been a hit with friends and family so I decided to feature the recipe here and share some tips for making them outstanding.</p>
