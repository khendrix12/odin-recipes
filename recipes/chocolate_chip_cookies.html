    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>My take on the original toll house chocolate chip cookie recipe. I use brown butter, age the cookie dough, and broil the cookies before baking them to cook the outside of the cookies while leaving the interior gooey.</p>
    <h2>Tips</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use brown butter!</strong> Brown butter adds a deep, toffee-like flavor to the cookies that increases their complexity.</li>
        <li><strong>Sweet and Salty is the way.</strong> Up the salt content a bit to enhance the flavor of the chocolate chips and contrast with the sweetness of the cookies.</li>
        <li><strong>Baked on the outside, perfectly gooey on the inside.</strong> Broil the cookie dough very briefly and bake them closer to the bottom of the oven. This will set the tops and bottoms of the cookies while leaving them gooey inside.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Dry<br><ul>
            <li>2.25 cups of AP flour</li>
            <li>1 tsp baking soda</li>
            <li>1 tbsp ksoher salt</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li>Wet
            <ul>
                <li>0.75 cups white sugar</li>
                <li>0.75 cups brown sugar</li>
                <li>1 cup brown butter, see <a href="../recipes/brownbutter.html">this recipe.</a></li>
                <li>2 eggs</li>
                <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine dry ingredients, set aside.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, cream sugars and brown butter.</li>
        <li>Add eggs and vanilla to the butter/sugar mixture and combine.</li>
        <li>Incorporate the dry mixture into the wet mixture in small portions until completely combined.</li>
        <li>Let the cookie dough "age" overnight in the fridge before baking.</li>
        <li>Set one oven rack at the highest position, set another at the second from bottom position. Preheat broiler on high.</li>
        <li>Shape cookie dough into balls and place on a greased cookie sheet.</li>
        <li>Broil until golden brown on the tops (using the upper rack), this can happen very quickly so keep a close eye on the cookies.</li>
        <li>Set oven to 375 and let cool. When the temp has dropped you can put the cookies back in (on the lower rack) for 8 minutes.</li>
        <li>Let cool for a few minutes and enjoy!</li>
