    <h1>Brown Butter</h1>
    <img src="../img/brown_butter.jpeg">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Butter that has had its milk fats toasted so that it takes on a nutty, toffee-like flavor. This subtly enhanced butter is fantastic in chocolate chip cookies, brownies, or even in simple pasta dishes.</p>
    <h2>Tips</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Do Not Rush!</strong> Butter takes time to brown, and if the heat is too high it will burn quickly and the entire batch will be ruined.</li>
            <li><strong>Use Gentle Heat.</strong> You want a steady, gentle heat. I never stray above 4/10 on my electric range. Experiment with what works best on your range but I would not go above a "Medium" heat.</li>
            <li><strong>Use a saucepan with a lightly colored bottom.</strong> If you are using a nonstick or cast iron pan you will not be able to see when the milk solids begin to turn color and it will be much more difficult to gauge when to pull the pan off the range.</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Unsalted butter</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Set a saucepan over medium-low heat. Add desired quantity of butter, at least one stick.</li>
        <li>As the butter melts, gently stir. The butter may foam up a bit as the water boils out.</li>
        <li>Once the water has boiled out and the foam has subsided the milk fats will begin to caramellize. Continue stirring to keep them from sticking to the bottom.</li>
        <li>Knowing exactly when to take the butter off the heat will take some experience but as soon as you see many brown specks floating in the butter it is best to pull it to keep from burning. You will likely smell toffee when it is ready.</li>
        <li>Transfer to a heat-safe bowl and stir to continue to cool down the butter. Leaving it in the same pan and/or not stirring can allow the butter to burn in its own heat.</li>
        <li>Use immediately or refrigerate.</li>

    </ol>
